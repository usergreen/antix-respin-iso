Persist Details:
for details on some of these options.

    Frugal
    Copy files from the install media (LiveCD/USB) to an internal hard drive partition and finish booting from that. Think of this as a to-disk analogy of toram boot parameter.
    Root Persist
    Save all the changes to the file-system in RAM and then transfer these changes to disk right before you shutdown or reboot. Fast, but space is limited by how much RAM you have.
    Static Root
    Saves all your file-system changes directly to a file. This can be slow but it requires no extra RAM and no changes need to be transfered when you shutdown.
    Home Persist
    Only save changes to files and directories under /home. This will include all of your bookmarks and personal settings. Changes are stored immediately and speed is almost never an issue.

This is an unofficial version of the antiX Linux derivative (re-spin). The standard desktop environment is the same as the official version, Rox-IceWM. This is a desktop environment that combines the Rox-Filer file manager with the IceWM window manager. The upstream base is antiX-22_x64-base.iso, which does not includs the office suite.

It includes several other desktops besides the standard desktop environment, including Fluxbox and JWM. You can use the menu to switch between them without having to log off.

It is considered a desktop environment that is not very commonly used, but it is light and practical. The following link provides an article explaining what it is about.
